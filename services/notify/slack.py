"""Slack notification for approved triage verdicts.

Posture (deliberate, and different from the triage path):

- **Never raises, never blocks.** By the time we notify, the nurse has already
  signed and the verdict is committed. A Slack outage must not fail an approval
  that already happened, so every failure here is logged and swallowed.
- **Output-filtered, fail-closed.** Invariant #2 applies to every generated
  string, and a staff channel is not an exception — Slack messages land on
  phone lock screens, get exported, and get screenshotted. If the filter
  blocks or errors, we do not post.
- **Minimal clinical content by construction.** The message carries urgency,
  fired rule IDs, and a link back to the worklist. Patient-identifying and
  clinical detail stays behind the link, where it is access-controlled.

Unset SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL disables notification entirely (logged once per call
site, never an error) — same graceful-degradation pattern as the other
integrations in this repo.
